# All About Software Development
Repo contians various software development methodology used in the Industry

## SDLC ( Software Development Life Cycle )
- SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization.

### Steps
- **Requirement Analysis and Planning** [ Customer Inputs, Market survey, Sales team, Industry/doamin experts ] Feasibility study
- **Defining Requirenments** [**SRS** : Software Requirement Specification]
- **Designing** [**DDS** : Design Document Specification]
- **Coding** [ Best practices and follow guidelines ]
- **Testing** - product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS
- **Deployment** - [**UAT** : User acceptance testing ] or A/B Testing. Deploy on Play-Store or App-Store or any other platform
- **Maintanance** - Optimise and Resolve bugs and/or blockers. [**CR** : Change Request] Server Maintanance and load balancing

## Software Development Process Approaches
- Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development.
  
  - **Waterfall Model** : Linear-Sequential life cycle model.
      - This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
      - In this waterfall model, the phases do not overlap.

  - **Iterative Model** [incremental build]
      - Iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the full            system is implemented
